Overview
This application scrapes data from various sources and uploads it to an AWS S3 bucket for further processing. The collected data will serve as the foundation for a machine learning project, where the data will be analyzed to create meaningful insights. These insights will be visualized on a front-end interface, providing users with an interactive way to explore and understand the results of the analysis.

Key Features:
Data Scraping: Collecting relevant data from predefined sources.
S3 Integration: The scraped data is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket for storage and access.
Machine Learning Analysis: The uploaded data will be processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms.
Frontend Visualization: Data analysis results will be visualized and presented in an interactive web interface.
Current Status
Data Scraping: The data scraping functionality is fully implemented and operational. The application collects data from multiple sources (e.g., web scraping, APIs) and processes it to extract the relevant features.

Data Upload to S3: The scraped data is successfully uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, where it is stored for further analysis. The application uses the boto3 Python library for interacting with AWS S3.

Machine Learning Pipeline: The data is ready to be processed and analyzed with machine learning algorithms. The next steps involve implementing specific analysis and model training for predictions, classifications, or other analyses based on the scraped data.

Frontend Integration: The analysis will eventually be displayed through a front-end interface, where the results of the machine learning models will be presented to users in an intuitive and interactive format.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for scraping, data handling, and uploading to S3.
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping to collect relevant data from the web.
Boto3: For interacting with AWS S3 and uploading data to the cloud.
AWS S3: Used for storing the scraped data.
Machine Learning Libraries: To process and analyze the data (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn).
Frontend Frameworks: To display the analysis results on a web interface (e.g., React.js).
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/franciscomartinez45/Soccer-ML-app.git
cd project-name
Install Dependencies:

Ensure that you have Python installed, then run the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure AWS Credentials:

Ensure that you have AWS credentials set up on your machine for the boto3 library to access S3. You can configure them by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws configure
Or manually set them in your Python code (if necessary).

Run the Scraping Script:

To start the scraping process and upload the data to S3, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scrape_and_upload.py
Machine Learning Model:

Once the data is uploaded to S3, you can proceed with analyzing the data and building your machine learning model. Use the data stored in your S3 bucket for training and evaluation.

Frontend Integration:

The results of the machine learning analysis will eventually be integrated into a front-end dashboard. Use the relevant framework (e.g., React) to set up the front-end visualization.

Next Steps
Data Processing: Begin working on the machine learning models to analyze the data.
Model Training: Implement the training pipeline for machine learning models.
Frontend Development: Create the front-end interface to visualize the analysis results interactively.
Deploy the Application: Eventually deploy the full application (backend, analysis, and frontend) to a cloud service like AWS or Heroku.
