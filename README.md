# Project Name: Data Scraping and ML Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This application scrapes data from various sources and uploads it to an AWS S3 bucket for further processing. The collected data will serve as the foundation for a machine learning project, where the data will be analyzed to create meaningful insights. These insights will be visualized on a front-end interface, providing users with an interactive way to explore and understand the results of the analysis.

### Key Features:

- **Data Scraping**: Collecting relevant data from predefined sources.
- **S3 Integration**: The scraped data is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket for storage and access.
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: The uploaded data will be processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms.
- **Frontend Visualization**: Data analysis results will be visualized and presented in an interactive web interface.

## Current Status

- **Data Scraping**: The data scraping functionality is fully implemented and operational. The application collects data from multiple sources (e.g., web scraping, APIs) and processes it to extract the relevant features.
- **Data Upload to S3**: The scraped data is successfully uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, where it is stored for further analysis. The application uses the `boto3` Python library for interacting with AWS S3.

- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: The data is ready to be processed and analyzed with machine learning algorithms. The next steps involve implementing specific analysis and model training for predictions, classifications, or other analyses based on the scraped data.

- **Frontend Integration**: The analysis will eventually be displayed through a front-end interface, where the results of the machine learning models will be presented to users in an intuitive and interactive format.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for scraping, data handling, and uploading to S3.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping to collect relevant data from the web.
- **Boto3**: For interacting with AWS S3 and uploading data to the cloud.
- **AWS S3**: Used for storing the scraped data.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: To process and analyze the data (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn).
- **Frontend Frameworks**: To display the analysis results on a web interface (e.g., React.js).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/franciscomartinez45/Soccer-ML-app.git
   cd project-name

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials:**:
   ```
    aws configure
   ```

## Next Steps

- **Data Processing:** Begin working on the machine learning models to analyze the data.
- **Model Training:** Implement the training pipeline for machine learning models.
- **Frontend Development:** Create the front-end interface to visualize the analysis results interactively.
- **Deploy the Application:** Eventually deploy the full application (backend, analysis, and frontend) to a cloud service like AWS or Heroku.
